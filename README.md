## Motivation

The use of deep learning in the physical sciencs has rapidly accelerated over the past decade with the proliferation of facile computational packages, deep learning languages, and easily available cloud or local GPU computing capabiltiies. In paricular, the field of non-linear forward and inverse design has seen significant acceleration. However, the rapid development of the field has been spread across various journals and conferences, resulting in a need for a central repository for all projects related to the field. We hope other users find this repository useful for this application.
